The state and people were going through a very good time until they faced invasion from VILGAX (The most feared Emperor amongst all leaders throughout the universe from planet ALDABRA) , with the support of The Forever_Knights (commonly known as Pirates conquering different states and planets in the universe) and lastly WULKANUS (A general from planet ARBURIA well known for his strength and use of great strong attacks in defeating his opponents).");

Whispers of anticipation filled the air, and a flicker of hope ignited within the hearts of those who had lost everything. As the news of the prophecy spread, the oppressed people of Eldoria began to look to the skies and wonder when the Chosen One would arrive, clad in the armor of destiny, ready to face the evils that plagued their once-peaceful land.");

To silence everyone he told Bawa that he cannot predict the future and there is no one powerful other than Vilgax in the world. By saying this he told the forever knights to evict him of the state. He told everyone that whoever said anything about the prophecy will be executed infront of everyone.");
